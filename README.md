# cufoo

Polyglot CUDA language bindings.

Writing modern cross-platform CUDA language bindings for Python and Node.js (v8).

Part I - Project skeleton and simple kernels

- Introduction

- Target audience

- Aims
    - multi-platform
    - runtime flexibility
    - development flexibility

- Metabuild system (CMake)

- Project structure
    - Writing kernels
        - Define the kernel signature
        - Declare device-specific implementations
        - Invoking the kernel
    - Language specific vs agnostic bindings
    - Unit Testing
        - Runtime Performance testing



Part II - Memory management and more complex kernels.
